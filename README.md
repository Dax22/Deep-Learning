# Deep-Learning
Task 1:
Problem Statement:
• Load the CIFAR dataset and select a subset of three classes. 
• Split the training set into training and validation subset.
• Vectorize the images and encode the know class labels using categorical encoding.
• Design a fully connected neural network to perform multi-class classification of this data
• Justify your network design decisions (number of hidden layers, number of units per layer, loss 
function, and evaluation metric)
• Build and compile the network designed.
• Plot training and validation loss as a function of epochs, plot training and validation accuracy.
• Tune model hyper – parameters to improve performance.
• Retrain the final mode and test performance on the test collection.
• Report the performance obtained.
• Save and load the weights of the trained network
